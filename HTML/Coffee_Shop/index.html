    <p style="font-size:150%;">Outside of Italy, cappuccino is a coffee drink that today is typically composed of a single espresso shot and hot milk,
    with the surface topped with foamed milk.[2] Cappuccinos are most often prepared with an espresso machine. The espresso
    is poured into the bottom of the cup, followed by a similar amount of hot milk, which is prepared by heating and
    texturing the milk using the espresso machine steam wand. The top third of the drink consists of milk foam; this foam
    can be decorated with artistic drawings made with the same milk, called latte art.</p>

    <p style = "font-size:150%;">Coffee and milk have been part of European cuisine since the 17th century. Caffè e latte, Milchkaffee, café au lait and
    café con leche are domestic terms of traditional ways of drinking coffee, usually as part of breakfast in the home.
    Public cafés in Europe and the US seem to have no mention of the terms until the 20th century, although Kapuziner is
    mentioned in Austrian coffee houses in Vienna and Trieste in the 2nd half of 1700s as "coffee with cream, spices and
    sugar" (being the origin of the Italian cappuccino).</p>

    <p style = "font-size:150%;">Iced coffee is a coffee beverage served cold. It may be prepared either by brewing coffee in the normal way and then
    serving it over ice or in cold milk, or by brewing the coffee cold. In hot brewing, sweeteners and flavoring may be
    added before cooling, as they dissolve faster. Iced coffee can also be sweetened with pre-dissolved sugar in water. 
    Pre-packaged iced coffee is available as a grocery item in several countries, though without ice. Iced coffee is also
    regularly available in most coffee shops. Iced coffee is generally brewed at a higher strength than normal coffee, since
    it is diluted by the melting ice.</p>
